🧠 How It Works

- When a task is completed, it gets a strike-through effect and its appearance fades slightly to indicate completion.
- Completed tasks can be undone at any time, restoring them to their normal state.
- Tasks can be deleted permanently using the delete option.
- All tasks and progress are saved automatically using LocalStorage, ensuring your data remains even after refreshing or closing the browser.
- A Reset option is provided to clear all tasks and statistics whenever needed.
- Statistics update automatically, including:
   - Total tasks added
   - Completed tasks
   - Deleted tasks
